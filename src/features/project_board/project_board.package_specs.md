# Project Board Feature Specification

## Overview
The Project Board feature provides the main interface for visualizing and managing tasks across different status categories. It implements a kanban-style board with columns for each task status and provides comprehensive drag-and-drop functionality for both status updates and task reordering.

## Product Requirements
- Display tasks organized into columns by status (todo, in-progress, done)
- Allow users to view all tasks at a glance
- Support dragging tasks between status columns to update their status
- Support reordering tasks within the same column through drag-and-drop
- Display task cards with key information (title, priority, assignee, etc.)
- Provide ability to open task details by clicking on a task card
- Support task filtering and sorting options
- Maintain responsive layout across different device sizes
- Support keyboard navigation and accessibility requirements
- Provide visual feedback during drag operations:
  - Semi-transparent dragged card with preview following cursor
  - Highlighted column borders when dragging over columns (using a vivid blue border)
  - Drop placeholder between cards showing exact insertion point where card will be positioned
  - Cards moving apart to make space for the dragged card
  - Placeholder dimensions matching exactly the dimensions of the dragged card

## Technical Requirements
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Follow SOLID principles through a well-structured component hierarchy:
  - ProjectBoard: Overall coordination and state management
  - TaskColumn: Column-specific rendering and interactions
  - DragAndDropManager: Complex drag and drop logic
  - DropPlaceholder: Visual placeholder for drag operations
- Implement comprehensive drag-and-drop functionality for both cross-column and within-column operations
- Calculate exact drop positions for precise card placement based on mouse/touch position
- Implement exact positioning logic to place cards between the nearest cards where the card was dropped
- Optimize performance for large numbers of tasks
- Support responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Implement proper keyboard accessibility
- Ensure component reusability
- Maintain type safety throughout implementation
- Implement visual feedback for all drag-and-drop interactions

## Behavioral Expectations
- When a task is dragged between columns, its status should update immediately
- When a task is dragged within the same column, it should be reordered precisely at the drop position
- When a card is dropped between two cards, it should be positioned exactly at the drop location, not just at the beginning or end of the list
- The system should insert the card at the exact position between the cards closest to where it was dropped
- Task cards should open a detail view when clicked
- Task cards should have an edit button that logs the task ID and title to the console when clicked
- Empty columns should display appropriate messaging
- Columns should scroll independently if they contain many tasks
- Drag operations should provide comprehensive visual feedback:
  - Cards should appear semi-transparent when being dragged
  - A drag preview should follow the cursor
  - Columns should be highlighted with a vivid blue border when dragged over
  - Cards should move apart to create space for the drop placeholder
  - A drop placeholder with dimensions matching the dragged card should appear between cards indicating exact insertion point
- The board should remain usable on smaller screens (using appropriate responsive design)
- Touch-based dragging should work smoothly on mobile devices

## Component Structure
The Project Board feature consists of:
- A main ProjectBoard component for overall coordination
- TaskColumn components for individual status columns
- Integration with TaskCard components from the UI library
- Integration with TaskModal components for editing
- DragAndDropManager for handling complex drag-and-drop logic
- DropPlaceholder component for visual feedback during drag operations
