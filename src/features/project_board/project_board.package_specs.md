# Project Board Feature Specification

## Overview
The Project Board feature provides the main interface for visualizing and managing tasks across different status categories. It implements a kanban-style board with columns for each task status and provides drag-and-drop functionality for status updates.

## Product Requirements
- Display tasks organized into columns by status (todo, in-progress, done)
- Allow users to view all tasks at a glance
- Support dragging tasks between status columns to update their status
- Display task cards with key information (title, priority, assignee, etc.)
- Provide ability to open task details by clicking on a task card
- Support task filtering and sorting options
- Maintain responsive layout across different device sizes
- Support keyboard navigation and accessibility requirements

## Technical Requirements
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality
- Optimize performance for large numbers of tasks
- Support responsive design
- Implement proper keyboard accessibility
- Ensure component reusability
- Maintain type safety throughout implementation

## Behavioral Expectations
- When a task is dragged between columns, its status should update immediately
- Task cards should open a detail view when clicked
- Empty columns should display appropriate messaging
- Columns should scroll independently if they contain many tasks
- Drag operations should provide visual feedback
- The board should remain usable on smaller screens (using appropriate responsive design)

## Component Structure
The Project Board feature consists of:
- A main ProjectBoard component
- Status column components
- Integration with TaskCard components from the UI library
- Integration with TaskModal components for editing
