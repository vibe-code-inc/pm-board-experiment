# Project Board Feature Specification

## Overview
The Project Board feature provides a visual kanban-style interface for managing tasks across different status columns (todo, in-progress, done). It allows users to view, organize, and update task status through drag-and-drop interactions.

## Product Requirements
- Display tasks organized by status in columns
- Show task cards with clear visual representation of priority and other metadata
- Allow users to drag and drop tasks between status columns
- Enable filtering and sorting of tasks
- Provide a way to edit task details
- Enable adding new tasks to the board

## Technical Requirements
- Implement responsive column layout
- Support drag and drop functionality for task cards
- Maintain task state and handle updates
- Integrate with task management features
- Ensure accessibility for keyboard-only users

## Behavioral Expectations
- Tasks should move smoothly between columns when dragged
- Visual feedback should be provided during drag operations
- Status updates should be reflected immediately
- Task cards should be expandable/clickable to view and edit details
- Empty columns should display a placeholder message

## Interfaces
```typescript
interface ProjectBoardProps {
  project: Project;
  onTaskUpdate: (taskId: string, newStatus: Task['status']) => void;
  onTaskEdit: (updatedTask: Task) => void;
}
```
