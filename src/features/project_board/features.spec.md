# Project Board Feature Specification

## Overview
The Project Board feature provides a visual kanban-style interface for managing tasks across different status columns (todo, in-progress, done). It allows users to view, organize, and update task status through drag-and-drop interactions.

## Product Requirements
- Display tasks organized by status in columns
- Show task cards with clear visual representation of priority and other metadata
- Allow users to drag and drop tasks between status columns
- Enable filtering and sorting of tasks
- Provide a way to edit task details
- Enable adding new tasks to the board
- Support responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Show appropriate empty states when no tasks are present

## Technical Requirements
- Implement responsive column layout
- Support drag and drop functionality for task cards
- Maintain task state and handle updates
- Integrate with task management features
- Ensure accessibility for keyboard-only users
- Optimize performance for boards with many tasks
- Implement visual feedback for drag operations
- Use custom hooks for drag and drop functionality

## Behavioral Expectations
- Tasks should move smoothly between columns when dragged
- Visual feedback should be provided during drag operations
- Status updates should be reflected immediately
- Task cards should be expandable/clickable to view and edit details
- Empty columns should display a placeholder message
- Task cards should show priority with appropriate visual cues
- Columns should be resized appropriately on different screen sizes
- Task count should be updated in column headers when tasks are moved

## Interfaces
```typescript
interface ProjectBoardProps {
  project: Project;
  onTaskUpdate: (taskId: string, newStatus: Task['status']) => void;
  onTaskEdit: (updatedTask: Task) => void;
  onTaskCreate: (newTask: Omit<Task, 'id'>) => void;
}

interface ColumnProps {
  tasks: Task[];
  status: Task['status'];
  onTaskDrop: (taskId: string, newStatus: Task['status']) => void;
  onTaskEdit: (taskId: string) => void;
}
```
