# Base UI Components Specification

## Overview
The Base UI Components package provides the foundational design system elements used throughout the PM Board application. It includes primitive components like buttons, inputs, selects, and textareas that can be composed to build more complex UI features.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement components with React and TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Create accessible components that follow WCAG guidelines
- Support responsive design
- Implement consistent theming
- Support keyboard navigation
- Provide consistent component interfaces
- Ensure components are easily customizable
- Support common variant patterns

## Component Guidelines
- All components should use the `cn` utility for class name merging
- Components should support passing additional props to the underlying HTML elements
- Every component should have comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Components should have sensible defaults for all optional props
- Variants should be implemented through props
- All components should be responsive by default
- Components should support all standard HTML attributes for their base element

## Included Components
1. Button - For various action buttons
2. Input - For text input fields
3. Select - For dropdown selection
4. Textarea - For multiline text input

## Package Structure

```
/design_kit
  /button
    button.tsx - Component implementation
    button.specs.md - Component specification
  /input
    input.tsx - Component implementation
    input.specs.md - Component specification
