# Base UI Components Specification

## Overview
The Base UI Components package provides the foundational design system elements used throughout the PM Board application. It includes primitive components like buttons, inputs, selects, and textareas that can be composed to build more complex UI features.

## Product Requirements
- Provide a consistent design language across the application
- Ensure all components are accessible to all users
- Support responsive design for all screen sizes
- Maintain visual consistency across all components
- Provide proper visual feedback for all interactive states
- Create reusable building blocks for more complex components
- Ensure all components work with keyboard, mouse, and touch input

## Technical Requirements
- Implement components with React and TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with project class naming conventions
- Create accessible components that follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Support responsive design across all device sizes
- Implement consistent theming with Tailwind variables
- Support keyboard navigation and focus management
- Provide proper ARIA attributes for all interactive elements
- Ensure components are easily customizable
- Support common variant patterns
- Use types instead of interfaces as per project conventions
- Implement proper error handling for all components
- Ensure focus states are clearly visible for keyboard users
- Provide proper screen reader announcements

## Component Guidelines
- All components should use the `cn` utility for class name merging
- Components should support passing additional props to the underlying HTML elements
- Every component should have comprehensive TypeScript types (not interfaces)
- Components should have sensible defaults for all optional props
- Variants should be implemented through props
- All components should be responsive by default
- Components should support all standard HTML attributes for their base element
- Input-based components should provide proper label associations
- Form components should provide consistent error reporting
- All components should maintain a clean, minimal API
- Components should follow the single responsibility principle
- Components should maintain proper DOM nesting

## Included Components
1. Button - For various action buttons
2. Input - For text input fields
3. Select - For dropdown selection
4. Textarea - For multiline text input

## Package Structure
Each component should be placed in its own directory with the following structure:
```
/design_kit
  /button
    button.tsx - Component implementation
    button.specs.md - Component specification
  /input
    input.tsx - Component implementation
    input.specs.md - Component specification
  ...
```

## Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must be operable via keyboard
- Focus states must be clearly visible
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Form controls must have associated labels
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with their inputs
- Components should work properly with screen readers
- Touch targets should be at least 44Ã—44 pixels for mobile devices
- All functionality should be available without requiring complex gestures
