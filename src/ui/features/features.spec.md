# UI Feature Components Specification

## Overview
The UI Feature Components are complex, reusable UI elements that implement specific feature-related functionality. These components combine base UI components and domain-specific logic to create higher-level UI elements.

## Technical Requirements
- Build components with React and TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Ensure components are fully typed with proper props interfaces
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Create responsive components that work across device sizes
- Implement proper state management
- Provide consistent user interactions
- Optimize performance for complex components

## Feature Components
The feature components include the following UI elements:

### Task Card
UI component for displaying task information:
- Visual representation of task details
- Priority indicators
- Status badges
- Assignee information
- Due date display
- Interactive elements for task operations

### Task Modal
Modal interface for task creation and editing:
- Form inputs for all task properties
- Validation of required fields
- Status selection
- Priority selection
- Due date picker
- Save and cancel actions

## Component Conventions
- Feature components should follow the same patterns as base components
- Components should be self-contained with their own state management
- Complex logic should be extracted into custom hooks
- Components should provide proper event handlers for parent components
- Visual consistency should be maintained with the design system
