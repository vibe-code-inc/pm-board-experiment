# Feature UI Components Specification

## Overview
Feature UI components are complex, reusable UI elements that are specific to certain features of the application. These components combine base UI components and implement feature-specific business logic and presentation.

## Product Requirements
- Provide feature-specific UI components that encapsulate complex interactions
- Maintain consistent styling with the base design system
- Support all required data display and interaction patterns
- Ensure components are accessible
- Implement responsive behavior for different screen sizes

## Technical Requirements
- Build components using React and TypeScript
- Use base UI components from the design kit
- Implement complex state management within components as needed
- Ensure components are fully typed with TypeScript
- Separate business logic from presentation concerns
- Support keyboard navigation and screen readers

## Behavioral Expectations
- Components should handle all states: loading, empty, error, and data-populated
- Interactive elements should provide appropriate feedback
- Components should gracefully handle edge cases and errors
- Performance should be optimized, especially for components rendering large data sets
- Components should maintain internal consistency with their own state

## Feature Components Structure
The features directory contains the following component categories:
- task_card - Card component for displaying task information
- task_modal - Modal component for creating and editing tasks
