# Feature UI Components Specification

## Overview
The Feature UI Components package provides specialized, complex UI components built specifically for the PM Board application's features. These components combine base UI components and custom logic to create reusable interface elements for specific application needs.

## Technical Requirements
- Implement components with React and TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Build on top of base UI components where appropriate
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Ensure proper accessibility
- Support keyboard navigation
- Follow consistent naming and API patterns
- Document component interfaces clearly
- Optimize for performance with memoization where needed

## Component Guidelines
- All components should follow the established naming conventions
- Components should be focused on specific use cases
- Complex logic should be extracted into custom hooks
- Components should be thoroughly typed with TypeScript
- Each component should have comprehensive props documentation
- Components should handle edge cases gracefully
- Error states should be handled appropriately
- Loading states should be implemented where relevant

## Included Components
1. Task Card - For displaying task information in a card format
2. Task Modal - For viewing and editing task details in a modal interface
