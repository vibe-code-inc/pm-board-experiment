# Feature UI Components Specification

## Overview
The Feature UI Components package provides specialized, complex UI components built specifically for the PM Board application's features. These components combine base UI components and custom logic to create reusable interface elements for specific application needs.

## Product Requirements
- Provide specialized UI components tailored to the application's feature needs
- Ensure all feature components follow the same design language as base components
- Support specific interaction patterns required by PM Board features
- Maintain consistent behavior across related components
- Ensure accessibility for all users
- Support responsive design for all viewport sizes
- Provide appropriate feedback for all user actions
- Maintain high performance even with complex interactions

## Technical Requirements
- Implement components with React and TypeScript
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with project class naming conventions
- Build on top of base UI components where appropriate
- Implement responsive design for all components
- Ensure proper accessibility following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Support keyboard navigation and focus management
- Follow consistent naming and API patterns
- Document component types clearly
- Optimize for performance with memoization where needed
- Use types instead of interfaces as per project conventions
- Implement drag and drop with proper accessibility considerations
- Provide proper ARIA attributes for all interactive elements
- Implement proper error handling and visual feedback
- Ensure proper focus management for modal components

## Component Guidelines
- All components should follow the established snake_case naming conventions
- Components should be focused on specific use cases
- Complex logic should be extracted into custom hooks
- Components should be thoroughly typed with TypeScript
- Each component should have comprehensive props documentation
- Components should handle edge cases gracefully
- Error states should be handled appropriately
- Loading states should be implemented where relevant
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Implement proper input validation
- Provide clear visual feedback for all user interactions
- Ensure all components work with keyboard, mouse, and touch input
- Maintain immutable data patterns for state updates

## Included Components
1. Task Card - For displaying task information in a card format
2. Task Modal - For viewing and editing task details in a modal interface

## Package Structure
Each component should be placed in its own directory with the following structure:
```
/features
  /task_card
    task_card.tsx - Component implementation
    task_card.specs.md - Component specification
  /task_modal
    task_modal.tsx - Component implementation
    task_modal.specs.md - Component specification
  ...
```

## Accessibility Requirements
- All interactive elements must be operable via keyboard
- Drag and drop operations must have keyboard alternatives
- Focus states must be clearly visible
- Modal dialogs must trap focus appropriately
- Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Form controls must have associated labels
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with their inputs
- Status changes must be announced to screen readers
- Touch targets must be at least 44Ã—44 pixels for mobile devices
- All draggable items must include proper ARIA attributes
