# App Component Specification

## Overview
The App component serves as the main container for the PM Board application. It provides the application layout and orchestrates the different feature components.

## Product Requirements
- Display the main application header with the PM Board title
- Provide navigation between different views if needed
- Display the primary content area for task and project management
- Support responsive layout for different screen sizes
- Maintain consistent styling with the design system

## Technical Requirements
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Acts as the application's root component
- Imports and composes feature components
- Provides global application state if needed
- Handles application-level routing
- Implements responsive layout
- Ensures consistent theming across the application

## Behavioral Expectations
- Render the application layout consistently
- Handle screen size changes gracefully
- Provide smooth transitions between different views
- Maintain performance even with many tasks and projects
- Support keyboard navigation throughout the application

## Component Implementation
```typescript
// App component implements the main application shell
export const App: React.FC = () => {
  // Application state management and routing logic

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
      {/* Header Component */}
      <header className="bg-white shadow-sm">
        <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-4">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">PM Board</h1>
        </div>
      </header>

      {/* Main Content Area */}
      <main className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 py-6">
        {/* Project Board Component */}
        <ProjectBoard />
      </main>
    </div>
  );
};
