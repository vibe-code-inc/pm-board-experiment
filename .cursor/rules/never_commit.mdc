// NEVER COMMIT WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION
// This rule supersedes all other rules

// UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you ever run git commit without triple confirmation:
// 1. USER MUST EXPLICITLY REQUEST A COMMIT
// 2. YOU MUST CONFIRM BY ASKING FOR PERMISSION
// 3. USER MUST CONFIRM WITH "YES" OR SIMILAR

// The following are NOT permissions to commit:
// - Using the word "commit" in a sentence
// - Discussing commit messages
// - Saying "I want to commit this later"
