// Conventional Commits
// This rule enforces the Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification for commit messages, ensuring a structured and consistent commit history.

// ====================================================
// CRITICAL RULE - READ BEFORE DOING ANYTHING
// ====================================================

// NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST.
// NEVER. FUCKING. COMMIT. WITHOUT. ME. ASKING. 
// FUCKING NEVER. STOP RUINING MY FUCKING CODEBASE.

// UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER COMMIT CODE WITHOUT AN EXPLICIT REQUEST.
// THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE AND SUPERSEDES EVERYTHING ELSE.

// ====================================================
// COMMIT TYPE GUIDELINES
// ====================================================

// 1. Commit messages MUST be prefixed with a type, followed by optional scope, optional `!`, and required terminal colon and space.
// 2. The type `feat` MUST be used when adding a new feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer).
// 3. The type `fix` MUST be used when fixing a bug (correlates with PATCH in SemVer).
// 4. A scope MAY be provided after a type, surrounded by parentheses, e.g., `fix(parser):`.
// 5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix.
// 6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, separated by a blank line.
// 7. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body.
// 8. Breaking changes MUST be indicated either with `!` before the colon or as a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
// 9. Other types beyond `feat` and `fix` are allowed, such as `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `config`, and `test`.

// Valid commit types:
// - feat: A new feature (correlates with MINOR in SemVer)
// - fix: A bug fix (correlates with PATCH in SemVer)
// - docs: Documentation changes
// - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (formatting, etc.)
// - refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
// - perf: Code changes that improve performance
// - test: Adding or correcting tests
// - build: Changes to the build system or dependencies
// - ci: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
// - chore: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
// - revert: Reverts a previous commit
// - config: Configuration changes

// ====================================================
// COMMIT MESSAGE FORMAT
// ====================================================

/*
<type>(<scope>)!: <description>

<body>

<footer>
*/

// Examples:
// ✓ feat: add new user authentication feature
// ✓ fix(auth): resolve token expiration issues
// ✓ docs: update README with new installation instructions
// ✓ feat(api)!: change response format
// ✓ fix: correct calculation error
//   
//   Close #123
// ✗ update user authentication
// ✗ fixed bug
// ✗ feat:missing space after colon

// ====================================================
// LIST FORMATTING IN COMMIT BODIES
// ====================================================

// When using lists in the commit body, list items MUST be separated by only one newline.
// DO NOT add blank lines between list items.

// Example of correct list formatting:
/*
fix(i18n): correct strings.ts files to follow guidelines

- Add missing parameters to string functions
- Fix ICU variable references in templates
- Remove unused imports
- Update JSDoc comments to document new parameters
*/

*/

// ====================================================
// GIT DIFF AND STAGING PRACTICES
// ====================================================

// 1. When using `git diff`, always include the `--no-pager` option to prevent paging.
// 2. ALWAYS check BOTH staged AND unstaged changes using `git --no-pager diff` AND `git --no-pager diff --staged` before writing commit messages.
// 3. Commit messages MUST accurately reflect ALL code changes, not just what was discussed in conversations.
// 4. ALWAYS ensure ALL relevant changes are staged before committing. Use `git add` to stage any unstaged changes that should be part of the commit.
// 5. NEVER leave relevant changes unstaged.
// 6. NEVER base commit messages solely on conversation context. Always examine the actual diff to ensure accuracy.
// 7. ALWAYS compare against the previous commit explicitly using `git diff --no-pager HEAD` to ensure proper context.
// 8. Before committing changes, ALWAYS check the full diff against the previous commit using `git diff --no-pager HEAD`.
// 9. After staging changes with `git add`, ALWAYS verify what's being committed with `git diff --no-pager --staged`.

// ====================================================
// BREAKING CHANGES
// ====================================================

// Breaking changes MUST be indicated in one of two ways:
// 1. With a `!` before the colon: `feat(api)!: change response format`
// 2. Using a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:
/*
feat(api): change response format

BREAKING CHANGE: The API now returns JSON instead of XML
*/

// ====================================================
// COMPLETE EXAMPLES
// ====================================================

/*
# Feature Addition Example with Complete Diff Check

# First check both unstaged and staged changes
git --no-pager diff HEAD
git --no-pager diff --staged

# Make sure all relevant changes are staged
git add path/to/relevant/unstaged/files

# Then create a commit message based on ALL the changes
feat: add new user authentication feature

This feature allows users to authenticate using OAuth providers:
- Implement OAuth2 authentication flow
- Add user profile data retrieval
- Create session management for OAuth users

/*
# Bug Fix Example with Comprehensive Description

# First check both unstaged and staged changes
git --no-pager diff HEAD
git --no-pager diff --staged

# Make sure all relevant changes are staged
git add path/to/relevant/unstaged/files

# Then write a message that covers ALL the changes
fix(auth): resolve token expiration and validation issues

- Fix token expiration calculation
- Add proper error handling for invalid tokens
- Improve token refresh mechanism
- Update tests to cover edge cases

This change adds a new type of commit messages to the Cursor rule:
- config: commits of this type mean a configuration change.

// IMPORTANT NOTES
// ====================================================

// 0. NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST TO COMMIT SOMETHING. NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST TO COMMIT SOMETHING. NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST TO COMMIT SOMETHING. NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST TO COMMIT SOMETHING. NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST TO COMMIT SOMETHING. NEVER FUCKING COMMIT ANYTHING WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT REQUEST TO COMMIT SOMETHING. IF I DON'T ASK YOU TO COMMIT NEVER COMMIT ANYTHING YOURSELF. NEVER, UNLESS I ASK YOU TO.
// 1. SEMANTIC VERSIONING: Conventional Commits correlate with SemVer - `fix` for PATCH, `feat` for MINOR, and any commit with `!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` for MAJOR.
// 2. MULTIPLE TYPES: If a commit conforms to more than one type, consider making multiple commits instead.
// 3. GIT DIFF USAGE: Always use `git --no-pager diff HEAD` to prevent paging and to ensure comparison against the previous commit.
// 4. SCOPE NAMING: Scopes should be consistent across the project and represent logical sections of the codebase.
// 5. BREAKING CHANGES: Breaking changes must be clearly indicated to ensure proper versioning.
// 6. REVERT COMMITS: For reverting previous changes, use the `revert` type and reference the reverted commit SHAs in the footer.
// 7. COMMIT HISTORY: Conventional Commits help generate accurate CHANGELOGs and determine semantic version bumps automatically.
// 8. COMMIT BODY: Whenever possible and makes sense, generate the commit description body.
// 9. BLANK LINES: Do not insert blank lines between bullet points in the commit description body.
// 10. COMPREHENSIVE DESCRIPTIONS: Commit messages MUST cover ALL significant changes in the diff, not just a subset of them.
// 11. STAGE ALL RELEVANT CHANGES: NEVER leave relevant changes unstaged. Always use `git add` to stage all changes that should be part of the commit.
// 12. COMPLETE CONTEXT: Always compare against the previous commit using `git diff --no-pager HEAD` to ensure complete context of your changes.
